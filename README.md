This is a simple python library to generate many gnuplot graphs in a
single or a few steps.  Just load src/smart_gnuplotter.py into your
python script, create an object of the class smart_gnuplotter, and
call its graphs method; e.g.,

   import smart_gnuplotter
   g = smart_gnuplotter.smart_gnuplotter()
   g.graphs("sin(x)")
